Adventurer's are tasked with discovering the fate of the missing Alchemist "Neptunim".
They must either
	- find and bring him back safely
	- find his life's work. He was sure to keep his research in a backed up format

The alchemist:
	- lies in a deep sleep in his chambers wrapped in flowered vines
		- cannot be freed by conventional means.
				- the robot can "repair" him
					- he will awake enraged and fire off a mind altering effect (sleep?)
				- the PCs can use the control plants potion to free him
		- PCs can instead choose to take the alchemist's brain/punchcard

Vines:
	- Vine's attack when PC's enter the room
		- Dex saving throw to avoid being entangled (15)
		- Str saving throw to get out of entanglement (15)
			- or make loud noises
	- if the PC's make a loud noise vines retreat and the Construct from the North enters

Vine Room:
	Covered in vines that catch and crush intruders. They retreat at loud noises. {Destroy} {intruder} constructs will be summoned by loud noises, but are loud enough that vines avoid them. Fungal elves avoid this room. Under the vines are two suits of medium armor and a scroll of lightning.

South West Stairwell:
	Knee-deep water floods the bottom floor.

Pod Room:
	Filled with hundreds of fibrous pods containing rabid fungal elves, guests of the alchemist mutated by a magical disaster. Disturbing a pod causes d6 of them to emerge. Each 6 rolled adds another d6 to the total. A {repair} {cracks} construct is in here, working on the damaged wall.

Secret Treasure Pod Room:
	Gold/treasure - worth 500
	Spell Book of Gravity Shift
	Random Scroll
	2xDagger
	Longsword
	Shield

South East Hall:
	{Destroy} {intruder} construct patrols the hallway

Storage Room:
	Contains enough ingredients to brew potion recipe found in the library

Secret Treasure Storage Room:
	Gold/treasure - worth 1000
	Scroll of Hatred
	Scroll of Earthquake
	2x Random Scroll
	Helmet
	Shield
	

Workshop:
	{Repair} {Constructs} construct is in here, patching up the {retrieve} {punchcards} construct. If the players have a punchcard, the {retrieve} construct will follow them everywhere, demanding it back. Becomes violent if not complied with.

Stairs to Library:
	Humming magical barrier instead of a door. Disintegrates anything touching it that is not contained within the {retrieve} construct. Half a skeleton, cut off by the field, lies on the stairs.

Library:
	Mostly filled with rotten books, but a search reveals a readable Control Plants potion recipe book. The {Elves} and {Alchemist} punchcards hang on hooks in an alcove at the back of the room, along with a lever that deactivates the magical barrier at the room's entrance.

North West Hall:
	{destroy} {intruder} construct patrols the hallway

Lounge:
	Ruined sofas, moldy wallpaper

VIP Room:
	Broken Furniture. A scroll of silence is hidden in an end table. The balcony looks out into the pod room.

Bed Room:
	Ancient alchemist, dreaming in a bed entwined with flowers. Can only be woken if the {repair} construct repairs him. If this happens, he will be furious and cause flowers to sprout from every surface, which causes mind-altering effects of his choice. Bedside table contains a key to the lab's main door. Secret door to the lab is right behind the bed, which had been pulled a foot away from the wall.

Lab:
	Metallic main door is locked, unpickable. Covered in acidic etchings. Beating hard on it releases a cloud of acid. If you did this for long enough it might disintegrate the door. Instruments inside rea necessary to brew potion recipes, and would be very valuable to an alchemist.
