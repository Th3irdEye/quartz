##### 4.4.22
Hassachir transformed into Grasilex and tried to kill us
Member of the Th3irdEye Scrappers

##### 4.18.22
We start with a battle. It seems they are casters. They are using dark matter to gain DR.
Glowing wisps have been cast and are attached to us.

Found a note: "The Sardat's Advance"
The Sardat's Advance is what paid to attack us and capture Hassichir
Sardat Zolon Ulovestra - paid Scralen to take us out
		Bought an astroid and renamed it Ulovestra
		we have coordinates to get there now

##### 5.09.22
Sedona played by Chad finally joins the campaign.
Sardat Zolon Ulovestra has the Rune Drive right now
	They are trying to reverse engineer it
Sedona was kept off the books
	people outside Ulovestra's circle don't know about the attack on Nekondis
	May have to do with the crashed ship/the rune drive

Video on datapad found in our ship
	Alnaust Galeon Cool
	Bareth Nagoul
	find the "fulfilment of his work"
